# CIPHX : CIPHERING APP
#### We have created a ciphering app that will encrypt and decrypt messages. You can choose any ciphering method among many like PlayFair Cipher, Beaufort Cipher or Columner transposition cipher, etc.

##  How to access the app:

### 1. Clone or Download the files of this repo
### 2. Open the file name main.py in your device
### 3. Run it, and the app will launch

## How to use the app:

### 1. After launching the app, You will see a dropdown option onscreen in which you can select the method of ciphering. To complete the selection of choice, click the `SELECT` button onscreen.

### Use `F11` on keyboard for fullscreen view
### Use `ESC` on the keyboard for standard screen view

### 2. Click `Close Window` onscreen to close the app

### 3. After you select the ciphering method, a new window opens up where you can enter your message and key, according to the ciphering method.

### 4. Enter the message you want to encode or decode and key(if required), then press the `ENCODE` or `DECODE` button according to your choice.
### You will see the encoded or decoded message pop up

###  Press the `REFRESH` button after encoding or decoding each time.
###  Press the `BACK TO HOMESCREEN` button to go back to the main screen.
###  Press `F12` on keyboard for fullscreen view
###  Press `Home` on the keyboard for standard screen view
