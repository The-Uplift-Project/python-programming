# 30 Days of Code
These are the programs given in the 30 Days of Code challenge on Hackerrank. Each program has a separate file and also contains part of the questions. I have written all the programs in Python3.

### [**Day 0 :**](/30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D0-Hello-World.py) 
```
Just a simple "Hello World" program to display an input string. This was just a warm-up program before the actual challenges.
```
### [**Day 1 :**](/30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D1-Data-Types.py) 
```
A simple program to accept and display a sum of two numbers in integer and double types and also string concatenation with an input string. This was the first challenge and it was just to test out the functionality of the code.
```
### [**Day 2 :**](/30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D2-Operators.py) 
```
We had to write the function to solve the problem for given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal and we had to find and print the meal's total cost rounded to the nearest integer number.
```
### [**Day 3 :**](30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D3-Intro-to-Conditional-Statements.py) 
```
We had to write the function to solve the problem for given condition that for a given number we have to give a specific output. This was just to practice the conditional statements.
```
### [**Day 4 :**](30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D4-Class-vs-Instance.py) 
```
We had to differenciate between a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept. So, a class was initialised with age as a parameter and functions to increase the age of the instance and show appropriate message as output.
